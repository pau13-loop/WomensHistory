# Wommen's History Web PAge

> In this repository you'll find **Women's History Web Page**. This has been a school homework where we had to create a really simple web page, but the goal of this activity was straight to practice and know how work the responsive design for the web pages. We had to adjust our web page to be able to visualize it with different styles with three different devices that have a different size, like normal or big, medium and small. Everything that you'll find in this repository is front-end web development, the client-side.

## Motivation

The motivation I have found really interesting for this kata was to be able to work for the first time with different responsive designs and go by myself experimenting and learning how everything worked and how your web page responds to the different styles I went applying. I should say too that I love when our teacher leaves us completely free election to choose what we will like to do. Pretty much it feels like if you have the key of the creativity to theme your web page with whatever you'll like to do.

## Reflections

This has been a really interesting homework because how I said before, we had free choice to theme our web page with what we like because the main goal of this activity was experimenting and play with the responsive design. I thought it was going to be a lot harder to be honest, it has surprised me a bit how simple I've found to adjust my web page for different sizes that a device could have and be able to visualize it completely fine. The responsive design how I could observe has a lot of advantages like for example to get the public more engaged with your web page or make your web page a lot more portable. In the end I should say that my web page it turn out a lot more simple that I would like, but this is because I've been experimenting and learning about the responsive system and I have left a little aside the design of the web page, thing that now burns me a bit, but I'll like to improve it more when I'll have the chance in the future and more free time from my studies and work.
